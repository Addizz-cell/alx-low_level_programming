Singly Linked List Project

Description

This project implements a singly linked list data structure in C. It includes functions to manipulate and operate on linked lists following specific guidelines and constraints.

The project utilizes a custom-defined data structure list_t representing nodes in the singly linked list, consisting of a string, its length, and a pointer to the next node.

Requirements

	•	Operating System: This program was developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
	•	Compiler: gcc with flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	•	Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
	•	C Standard Library Functions: Only malloc, free, and exit are allowed. Use of other functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., is forbidden.

Installation

To compile the program, use the provided compilation command:

gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <list_of_files.c> -o <output_filename>

Replace <list_of_files.c> with the necessary .c files and <output_filename> with your desired executable name.

Usage

Execute the compiled program to test the implemented functionalities of the singly linked list. Ensure to include the necessary files in your compilation and use according to the provided function prototypes.

Files

	•	0-print_list.c: Implementation of the function print_list to print elements of the linked list.
	•	lists.h: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary structure definitions for the linked list.
